###  Backend Functionality

This project includes a lightweight **Node.js + Express** backend that acts as a **proxy server** for fetching data from the [FRED API](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/). It enhances security, avoids CORS issues, and allows flexible data processing.

---

#### Why We Use a Backend

- **Secure the API Key:** Keeps your FRED API key hidden from the frontend.
- **Bypass CORS:** Prevents browser restrictions on cross-origin requests.
- **üõ†Future Flexibility:** Easy to scale, cache responses, or add authentication.


The backend listens at: http://localhost:4000/api/observations?series_id=XXXX


It forwards the request to:  https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations

Along with:
- `series_id`
- your FRED `api_key`
- file type set to `json`

Then it returns the API response directly to the frontend in clean JSON format.

---

#### Technologies Used

- **Node.js**
- **Express.js**
- **Axios** for making HTTP requests
- **CORS** middleware to enable frontend access
